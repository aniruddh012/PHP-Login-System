# phploginsystem

Hii friends! Here I have created a PHP login signup system with the help of PHP and Mysql

Features:
  User can signup by choosing a unique username and a password.
  User can login by entering username and password through which user created his/ her account
  after login user will redirect to home page form there user can logout by taping only logout button.
  After logout user will redirect to login page.
  User's password will be secure to database by hashing the user's password.
